MICROS System (Java Replica)

Our project will be a basic version of the user interface that many resturants use
every day, the MICROS System or "Modular Integrated Cash Register Operating System".

Features:
- Will allow user to clock in using a personal four digit code.
- Options to begin a new tab or look up an existing tab.
- Holds open multiple tabs until the user checks out tabs individually.
- Once an individual tab is open, user will have access to the full resturant menu
    so they can enter customer orders that will be sent out to the kitchen and/or bar.
    [all individual tabs are kept in one place until the user clocks out]
- Once all tabs are closed, the user will print out an EOD (end of day) report that
    prints out an itemized receipt with food/drinks/liquor sales and shows the amount (in cash)
    the user owes the resturant or the amount the resturant owes the user.
- Gives user the option to update the menu on the interface if needed.
